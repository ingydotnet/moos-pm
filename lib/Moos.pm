=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package Foos;
    use Moos;

    extends 'Boos';

    has this => ();
    has that => 42;
    has other => (
        builder => 'build_other',
        lazy => 1,
    );

    sub BUILD {
        my $self = shift;
        # build, build, build
    }

    sub BUILDARGS {
        my ($self, @args) = @_;
        # munge, munge, munge
        return {%munged_args};
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Moos completes the M to Moose sequence of Perl OO modules.

This one is pure Perl, no dependencies, single file and Moose compatible (for
what it does). It is fairly minimal.

=head1 FEATURES

Here's a quick list of the L<Moose> compatible features that are supported by
L<Moos>:

=over

=item strict / warnings

Turns on C<strict> and C<warnings> for you.

=item extends

For inheritance. C<Moos::Object> is the default base class.

    package MyClass;
    extends 'MyBaseClass';

=item new

A constructor class method.

    my $object = MyClass->new(this => 'nice', that => 2);

=item BUILD

Custom object construction. If you define BUILD, it is passed the value of the
new object during construction. You can modify the object. Any value you
return is ignored.

    sub BUILD { my $self = shift; ... }

=item Helpful exports

The ever useful C<blessed> (from L<Scalar::Util>) and C<confess> (from
L<Carp>) are exported to your namespace.

=item has

Accessor generator. Supports the C<is>, C<default>, C<build>, C<lazy>,
C<clearer>, C<predicate>, C<required> and C<handles> options, described below.

    has this => ();

=item is

Specify which type of attribute accessor to provide. The default is "rw",
a read-write accessor. Read-only "ro" accessors are also supported.

    has this => ( is => "ro" );

=item default

Specify the sub to generate a default value.

    has this => ( default => sub { 42 } );

=item builder

Specify the method name to generate a default value.

    has this => ( builder => '_build_this' );
    has that => ( builder => 1 );  # accept default name for method

=item lazy

Don't generate defaults during object construction.

    has this => ( builder => '_build_this', lazy => 1 );

=item clearer

Creates a clearer method.

    has this => ( clearer => "clear_this" );
    has that => ( clearer => 1 );  # accept default name for method

=item predicate

Creates a predicate method, which can be used to check if the attribute is
set or unset.

    has this => ( predicate => "has_this" );
    has that => ( predicate => 1 );  # accept default name for method

=item required

Require that a value for the attribute be provided to the constructor or
generated during object construction.

    has this => ( required => 1 );

=item handles

Delegated method calls.

    has wheels => (handles => [qw/ roll /]);

This accepts a hashref or arrayref, but not the other possibilities
offered by L<Moose>.

=back

Note that currently all accessors are read-write by default and all unknown
options are silently ignored.

=head1 HAS DIFFERENCES

Moos has a few differences from Moose, regarding it's accessor support (ie the
'has' function).

The supported options detailed above are about the same as Moose. All other
arguments are currently ignored. All generated accessors are 'rw'. So you can
just say:

    has 'this';
    has that => ();

Unlike the other Mo* modules, Moos also supports just specifying the default.
If the number of arguments (after the name) is an odd number, then the first
value is the default. The following forms are valid:

    has a => 42;
    has b => 'string' => (lazy => 1);
    has c => {};
    has d => [1, 2, 3, 4];

These all result in creating a Moos C<default> argument. If the default is an
array or hash reference, a shallow copy is made.

=head1 DEV OPTIONS

Moos has a couple builtin dev options. They are controlled by environment
variables.

=over

=item PERL_MOOS_ACCESSOR_CALLS

By setting this environment variable, Moos will warn everytime an accessor
method is called.

=item PERL_MOOS_XXX

By setting the environment variable, Moos will export the L<XXX> debugging
keywords.

=back

=head1 WHENCE

I(ngy) created Moos during L<Pegex> development. Pegex uses a clone of Moos
called L<Pegex::Base>.

Pegex is a parser framework and needs to be fast. While looking into speed
issues I noted that accessor calling was the biggest hit. I tried all the
various Mo* solutions and L<Mouse> was the fastest.

I was happy until I remembered that Mouse uses XS, and for various reasons
this broke my toolchain (TestML, Module::Install, etc).

I tried to inline L<Moo> into one file but failed, and ended up with this.
I've shared Pegex::Base as L<Moos> in case any other projects want it.

Later on, Toby added a bunch of low-cost but very handy features from Moose.

=head1 ON SPEED

In the end, I got Pegex to run even faster with Moos than it originally did
with Mouse. I'll tell you my secret...

B<<Accessors I<(usually)> do not need to be method calls.>>

Replace these:

    my $foo = $self->foo;
    $self->foo($foo);

with:

    my $foo = $self->{foo};
    $self->{foo} = $foo;

And your code will be faster (and a bit uglier).

The only time that you need to call an accessor method is when you are reading
a property and it might invoke a C<lazy> C<builder> or C<default> method.
Otherwise you are just wasting time. At least with the minimal feature set
offered by Moos.

The PERL_MOOS_ACCESSOR_CALLS feature described above is for finding these
method calls.

Note that users of your module's accessor methods can still use the method
calls like they would expect to.

I'm sure I've missed some subtlties, and would be glad to hear opinions, but
in the meantime I'm happy that my code is faster and pure Perl.

=head1 CREDITS

Toby Inkster <tobyink@cpan.org> submitted a number of great pull requests,
making Moos a little bit more like Moose.
